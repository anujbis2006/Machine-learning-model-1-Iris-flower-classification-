🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This is my first machine learning project — a simple yet classic classification problem using the **Iris flower dataset**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify the species of an Iris flower based on four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

We used a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to train the model and achieved high accuracy on the test set.

## 🔍 Model Details

- **Algorithm Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Library:** scikit-learn
- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~100% on test split (due to simplicity of the dataset)

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `streamlit`
- `pickle`

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification
